# Ansible in our setup

I asked copilot about this for p1 and apparently is a good idea.

Currently, your Vagrantfile provisions the servers using shell scripts (server.sh and worker.sh). This works, but as your environment grows or becomes more complex, shell scripts can be harder to maintain and less flexible.

**How Ansible would help:**
- **Readability:** Ansible playbooks are easier to read and organize than long shell scripts.
- **Idempotency:** Ansible ensures tasks only run if needed (e.g., only installs packages if missing).
- **Extensibility:** Easily add roles for monitoring, networking, users, etc.
- **Centralized management:** Manage both VMs from one playbook, with variables for each host.

**How to use Ansible with Vagrant:**
1. **Install Ansible** on your host machine.
2. **Create an Ansible playbook** for your K3s setup.
3. **Configure Vagrant** to use Ansible as a provisioner, or run Ansible manually after `vagrant up`.
4. **Use Vagrantâ€™s built-in inventory** to target your VMs.

**Example Vagrantfile snippet for Ansible:**
```ruby
config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
  ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
  ansible.inventory_path = "inventory.ini"
end
```
