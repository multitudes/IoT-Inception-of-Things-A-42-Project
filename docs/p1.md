# ðŸš€ Part 1 (P1) - Setting up K3s Cluster

This part sets up a basic Kubernetes cluster using K3s with one server node and one worker node.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Vagrant installed on your system
- VirtualBox or compatible hypervisor
- At least 4GB of available RAM

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the P1 directory

```bash
cd p1
```

### 2. Start the virtual machines

```bash
vagrant up
```

> **Note**: You will be prompted **2 times** with the question "Which interface should the network bridge to?". 
> 
> **Response**: Enter `1` for both prompts to use the first available network interface.
> 
> **Why**: This creates a bridged network connection allowing the VMs to communicate with each other and your host machine.

### 3. Verify the cluster setup

Connect to the server node and check the cluster status:

```bash
vagrant ssh ohoroS
sudo kubectl get nodes -o wide
exit
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What this accomplishes

- **Server Node (ohoroS)**: Acts as the Kubernetes control plane running K3s
- **Worker Node (ohoroW)**: Joins the cluster as a worker node
- **Network Bridge**: Enables communication between nodes and external access
- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution perfect for IoT and edge computing

## âœ… Expected Output

After running `kubectl get nodes -o wide`, you should see:
- Both nodes in "Ready" state
- The ip of ohoroS (the server node) should be 192.168.56.110 as stated in the subject
- The ip of ohoroSW (the worker node) should be 192.168.56.111 as stated in the subject

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

When you're done testing, clean up the resources:

```bash
vagrant destroy -f
```
